Why America’s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis From 1915 through the 1990s, amid vast improvements in hygiene, nutrition, living conditions and health care, the number of babies of all races who died in the first year of life dropped by over 90 percent — a decrease unparalleled by reductions in other causes of death. But that national decline in infant mortality has since slowed. In 1960, the United States was ranked 12th among developed countries in infant mortality. Since then, with its rate largely driven by the deaths of black babies, the United States has fallen behind and now ranks 32nd out of the 35 wealthiest nations. Low birth weight is a key factor in infant death, and a new report released in March by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin suggests that the number of low-birth-weight babies born in the United States — also driven by the data for black babies — has inched up for the first time in a decade. Black infants in America are now more than twice as likely to die as white infants — 11.3 per 1,000 black babies, compared with 4.9 per 1,000 white babies, according to the most recent government data — a racial disparity that is actually wider than in 1850, 15 years before the end of slavery, when most black women were considered chattel. In one year, that racial gap adds up to more than 4,000 lost black babies. Education and income offer little protection. In fact, a black woman with an advanced degree is more likely to lose her baby than a white woman with less than an eighth-grade education. This tragedy of black infant mortality is intimately intertwined with another tragedy: a crisis of death and near death in black mothers themselves. The United States is one of only 13 countries in the world where the rate of maternal mortality — the death of a woman related to pregnancy or childbirth up to a year after the end of pregnancy — is now worse than it was 25 years ago. Each year, an estimated 700 to 900 maternal deaths occur in the United States. In addition, the C.D.C. reports more than 50,000 potentially preventable near-deaths, like Landrum’s, per year — a number that rose nearly 200 percent from 1993 to 2014, the last year for which statistics are available. Black women are three to four times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as their white counterparts, according to the C.D.C. — a disproportionate rate that is higher than that of Mexico, where nearly half the population lives in poverty — and as with infants, the high numbers for black women drive the national numbers. Monica Simpson is the executive director of SisterSong, the country’s largest organization dedicated to reproductive justice for women of color, and a member of the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, an advocacy group. In 2014, she testified in Geneva before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, saying that the United States, by failing to address the crisis in black maternal mortality, was violating an international human rights treaty. After her testimony, the committee called on the United States to “eliminate racial disparities in the field of sexual and reproductive health and standardize the data-collection system on maternal and infant deaths in all states to effectively identify and address the causes of disparities in maternal- and infant-mortality rates.” No such measures have been forthcoming. Only about half the states and a few cities maintain maternal-mortality review boards to analyze individual cases of pregnancy-related deaths. There has not been an official federal count of deaths related to pregnancy in more than 10 years. An effort to standardize the national count has been financed in part by contributions from Merck for Mothers, a program of the pharmaceutical company, to the CDC Foundation. The crisis of maternal death and near-death also persists for black women across class lines. This year, the tennis star Serena Williams shared in Vogue the story of the birth of her first child and in further detail in a Facebook post. The day after delivering her daughter, Alexis Olympia, via C-section in September, Williams experienced a pulmonary embolism, the sudden blockage of an artery in the lung by a blood clot. Though she had a history of this disorder and was gasping for breath, she says medical personnel initially ignored her concerns. Though Williams should have been able to count on the most attentive health care in the world, her medical team seems to have been unprepared to monitor her for complications after her cesarean, including blood clots, one of the most common side effects of C-sections. Even after she received treatment, her problems continued; coughing, triggered by the embolism, caused her C-section wound to rupture. When she returned to surgery, physicians discovered a large hematoma, or collection of blood, in her abdomen, which required more surgery. Williams, 36, spent the first six weeks of her baby’s life bedridden. The reasons for the black-white divide in both infant and maternal mortality have been debated by researchers and doctors for more than two decades. But recently there has been growing acceptance of what has largely been, for the medical establishment, a shocking idea: For black women in America, an inescapable atmosphere of societal and systemic racism can create a kind of toxic physiological stress, resulting in conditions — including hypertension and pre-eclampsia — that lead directly to higher rates of infant and maternal death. And that societal racism is further expressed in a pervasive, longstanding racial bias in health care — including the dismissal of legitimate concerns and symptoms — that can help explain poor birth outcomes even in the case of black women with the most advantages.	1

Dairy Data The Dairy Data set includes data files covering domestic supply and demand and trade of various dairy products. Data on the U.S. dairy situation and commercial disappearance are updated monthly, and U.S. milk production and related data are updated quarterly. All other data files are updated annually. These include data on supply and allocation of milk fat and skim solids; dairy per capita consumption; fluid milk sales; milk supply by State and region; milk production and factors affecting supply and utilization of milk in all dairy products; and numbers and size of milk bottling plants. See Documentation for information on how the data were assembled, sources, and recent and upcoming changes to the data. Other data of interest for the dairy industry include Milk Cost of Production Estimates and Price Spreads from Farm to Consumer. Older archived dairy data, preceding the data files below, is available from the Dairy Yearbook (last updated in September 2005). Note the following: On May 14, changes were made relevant to calculations for dry skim milk products in the data set “Commercial disappearance for dairy product categories (monthly and annual).” Previously, there were annual and monthly worksheets for nonfat dry milk and skim milk powder (NDM and SMP). These worksheets have been changed to include columns for production and stocks of dry skim milk for animal use. Calculations of total disappearance and commercial disappearance for dry skim milk products reflect these changes. Titles of the worksheets now reflect that these worksheets are for dry skim milk products. On May 14, export data for milk in all products for 2020 were revised to include products exported under HS 0403900000 (buttermilk, curdled milk and cream, kephir and other fermented or acidified milk and cream). Export quantities have been reported for this product since January 2020. For years before 2020, export quantity data are unavailable for this product. This change is reflected in “Commercial disappearance of milk in all products (monthly and annual,” and “U.S. dairy situation at a glance (monthly and annual). The information concerning milk-fat and skim-solids conversion factors for the product has been added to the export worksheet in the “Dairy conversion factors and sources” file, available in the Conversion factors section of the ERS Dairy Data Documentation page.	0
Woman refused ride home before fatal walk on to I-285 A Dunwoody woman refused a ride from police shortly before she apparently walked on to I-285 where she was killed when struck by multiple cars, closing the interstate for hours Sandy Springs Police have released more clues Tuesday about 53-year-old Gayla Walker as they try to solve the mystery of how she ended up dying on the roadway Thursday morning. Dunwoody Police officers met with Walker for about 10 minutes around 5 a.m. at a service station on Ashford Dunwoody Road near the interstate after respoinding to a call about woman behaving erratically, Sandy Springs police said in an emailed statement to Channel 2 Action News. “Officers attempted to give Ms. Walker a ride home but she refused the offer,” police said. “Ms. Walker left the Exxon on foot walking southbound on Ashford Dunwoody Road. Once a photo was published of her after the accident, one of the original responding officers to the call at the Exxon recognized her.” Walker’s death was discovered during the Thursday commute when drivers reported her remains on the westbound roadway but misidentified them as belonging to an animal. When officers investigated they discovered human remains spread across multiple lanes of the busy interstate. Dunwoody Police Officer Timothy Fecht said police were called to an Exxon station near Perimeter Mall when Walker refused to leave the premises. Police offered Walker a ride to her apartment, but she refused, Fecht told WGCL-TV. “The officer said ‘Hey, is there a family member we can speak to, or a daughter,’” Fecht told the news station. Instead Walker told police not to call her family, Fecht said. The westbound interstate was shutdown at 6:35 a.m. for three hours.In the meantime, I-285 became a bumper-to-bumper mess that stretched more than 7 miles to beyond Spaghetti Junction, while eastbound traffic was jammed back to I-75 by onlooker delays. The gridlock wasn’t confined to I-285, either, as authorities shut down the ramps from Ga. 400 to I-285 westbound, leading to drive times of nearly 90 minutes to get from Alpharetta to I-285. Anyone with information about the incident can also submit an anonymous tip to Crime Stoppers at 404-577-8477. Support real journalism. Support local journalism.

Another 'insane' gunfight injures two kids Officers investigate the shootings of two children in a car Wednesday evening. Police found casings in an alley near N. 36th and W. Hadley streets. Credit: Michael Sears SHARE By of the In the wake of a shooting that Mayor Tom Barrett called "insane," police on Thursday arrested a felon who got into a gunfight while driving a van carrying seven children and their mother. Bullets hit two of the children, a 10-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl, who were taken to the hospital — but only after the driver was dropped off and the mother got behind the wheel. The children remained hospitalized Thursday; their injuries are not considered life-threatening, police said. The mother had recently received all seven children, ranging in age from 2 to 11 years old, back into her custody after allegations of child abuse, Police Chief Edward Flynn said at a news conference. Now, the children have been referred back to child welfare officials; they were not in the care of their mother Thursday. Earlier in the day, inspectors from the city's Department of Neighborhood Services condemned the house where the mother resided after finding it filled with feces, cockroaches and bedbugs. "Do these kids have a chance? Do kids have a chance who are put in harm's way by reckless parents?" Flynn said. The driver of the van, who was taken into custody on a probation violation, was driving in the 2800 block of N. 37th St. about 7 p.m. Wednesday when the altercation began. He had left prison in 2012 after reaching his mandatory release date. He had been convicted of shooting at a Milwaukee police officer who was trying to question him during an armed robbery investigation in 2007. Police have not yet identified other people involved in the shooting; they continue to investigate. "Any man who's in a vehicle where there are seven children and decides to get in a gunbattle is a coward because he's putting those children's life in danger, and I don't care what the dispute is, you do not put the lives of seven children in danger," Barrett said. Enraged and engaged So far this year, 13 children under the age of 14 have been shot in Milwaukee. Earlier this week, Pastor Don Darius Butler led funeral services for one of them: Sierra Guyton, a 10-year-old girl struck by gunfire as she and her sister visited a playground at Clarke Street School. On Thursday, Butler stood with Flynn, Barrett and Pastor John V. McVicker on the block where the 10-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl had been shot. "Every citizen of good will, of decency, of conscience should be enraged and should get engaged with any kind of activity that will cease this kind of violence that visits us too often," Butler said. Flynn and Barrett pledged an increased police presence in the north side neighborhood for at least the next four days. "We are going to make sure that the good people who live in this neighborhood can have their kids play outside in the summer just as every single parent in this city, in this county, in this state in this country, wants to have happen," Barrett said. Although homicides are down compared with this time last year, the city is averaging one more shooting each week, Flynn said. The number of shootings remains stubbornly high despite the department's efforts to take guns off the streets. Milwaukee police have confiscated 1,341 firearms in the city — and that figure that does not include the 353 firearms turned in during the gun buyback this spring led by faith leaders. For perspective, Flynn said, Milwaukee police had confiscated 1,190 as of July 6 — a 26% increase over last year. That figure barely trailed the New York City Police Department, which had confiscated 1,359 firearms as of July 6, according to figures provided by the police. "We have remorseless, reckless criminals in possession of high-quality firearms shooting at each other, and they don't care who they hit," Flynn said. Shelly Bishop lives in Walker's Point — where she can walk her poodle at 2 a.m. by herself and feel safe, she said — but often comes to the area of N. 37th and Hadley streets to visit her fiancé. She doesn't come after dark; that's when things get bad, she says. But sunlight was still streaming in the window Wednesday evening when she heard a boom-boom-boom and asked her daughter, an Army veteran, if the sound was gunshots or firecrackers. "This whole radius," she said motioning up and down the street, "they know the people involved. They're afraid of retaliation." Jesse Garza of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report. SHOOTINGS INVOLVING KIDS in 2014 So far this year, 13 children under the age of 14 have been shot in Milwaukee. Some examples: ■ A 4-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself March 19 in his home in the 2900 block of N. 45th St. with a handgun police suspected of belonging to a man who lived in the home who is a convicted felon. ■ An 11-year-old girl who was shot, along with a 29-year-old man, May 14 in an alley in the 4000 block of N. 25th St. ■ A 4-year-old who accidentally shot himself May 3 with a gun his mother left in her car. ■ A 4-year-old boy who was shot June 14 while with a 21-year-old man in the 2100 block of S. 15th St. ■ An 11-year-old girl who was shot in the leg June 15 during an attempted robbery at Sparkle Foods in the 2500 block of W. Hopkins St.	1
Bernie Sanders backs away from 2005 gun vote Story highlights Although Sanders' top aides deny that the decision is a flip-flop, Sanders' move backs away from statements he and his top aides made earlier in the campaign "I'm pleased that this legislation is being introduced," Sanders said of Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Adam Schiff's proposal to take away immunity from gun manufacturers when their products are used in crimes Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders backed away from a 2005 vote that gave gun manufacturers immunity from prosecution on Saturday night, announcing in a press release that he supports a proposed bill to amend that vote. The new position is a reversal from statements Sanders and his aides have made throughout the campaign. Aides to Hillary Clinton cast the decision as a way to soften his gun position the day before Sunday's fourth Democratic debate. "I'm pleased that this legislation is being introduced," Sanders said of Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Adam Schiff's proposal to take away immunity from gun manufacturers when their products are used in crimes. "As I have said for many months now, we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up." Sanders has declined to call the 2005 vote a mistake a number of times, citing the fact that he worries about the impact rescinding immunity would have on small, family-owned gun shops. "If somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible?" he asked at the Democratic debate in Las Vegas in October. "Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer. That is not what a lawsuit should be about." Read More	1
Yes, small businesses account for 99% of all Wisconsin companies The first full week in May is National Small Business Week, which has prompted a series of lawmakers to tout the role of small business in Wisconsin. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson — a longtime businessman himself — joined the chorus with a May 6, 2019 tweet: "99.4% of businesses in Wisconsin are small businesses," the Wisconsin Republican wrote. "This week, we celebrate the 1.2 million Wisconsinites who work for small businesses—nearly half of our workforce." In a manufacturing state dotted with a lot of physically imposing buildings, do we really have that many small businesses? Let’s get to work on that. Claim lines up with federal figures Johnson’s office said the stats come from a state profile generated by the U.S. Small Business Administration. 99.4% of businesses in Wisconsin are small businesses. This week, we celebrate the 1.2 million Wisconsinites who work for small businesses--nearly half of our workforce. #SmallBusinessWeek pic.twitter.com/BYMVBN2SDn — Senator Ron Johnson (@SenRonJohnson) May 6, 2019 The important note here is that the agency’s definition of a "small" business is, well, rather large. The categorization under federal standards varies by industry, but the SBA generally considers any business with fewer than 500 employees to be in the "small" category. In Wisconsin, 99.4% of businesses do indeed have fewer than 500 employees, according to the 2019 Small Business Profile from the SBA’s Office of Advocacy. The data is the latest available from the U.S. Census Bureau, though it comes from a 2016 analysis. RELATED: Is Wisconsin a Top 10 state for business (from 2017) In line with Johnson’s tweet, the SBA reports those small businesses employ 49.9% of all workers in Wisconsin. The report puts the tally at 1.3 million, however, not the 1.2 million Johnson referenced. That percentage would of course drop dramatically with a smaller definition of "small." Businesses with fewer than 20 employees accounted for about 500,000 jobs in 2016, which would be around 20% of the state workforce. Does that make Wisconsin a great state for small business? None of that speaks to whether Wisconsin is a good state for small business. The Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship tackles that task to an extent, using a variety of datasets to gauge each state’s rate of new entrepreneurs, number of new businesses starting due to opportunity (i.e. if the owner is coming from unemployment or another job), jobs created by new businesses and percentage of new businesses that survive their first year. Across all those measures, Wisconsin ranked 46th among the 50 states and Washington, D.C. in 2017. That’s up from dead last in 2016 but still the fourth straight year in the bottom 10. That’s just one of many potential indicators of the state’s business climate, based on surveys and data analysis. Some are more positive on Wisconsin, but most place Wisconsin at or below average. That led then-Gov. Scott Walker to get a Mostly False rating in 2017 for picking the most glowing of the recent results to claim Wisconsin was a Top 10 state for business. Our ruling Johnson’s tweet said small business is a big deal in Wisconsin, accounting for more than 99% of all businesses and half of all employment. That claim — based on the federal definition of a "small" business — is in line with the latest data. We rate his statement True.	0
Joe Biden's 2020 Ukrainian nightmare: A closed probe is revived Editor’s note: John Solomon’s columns regarding Ukraine became a subject of the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment inquiry against President Trump Donald John TrumpSouth Korea slams Bolton book as 'distorting the reality' of nuclear talks Democrats face tough questions with Bolton Protesters try to bring down statue of Andrew Jackson near White House MORE. Any updated information can be found at the end of the column. Two years after leaving office, Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump seeks to rally base with immigration full-court press Trump says Obama may have committed treason Poll: Biden leads Trump by more than 20 points on race and policing MORE couldn’t resist the temptation last year to brag to an audience of foreign policy specialists about the time as vice president that he strong-armed Ukraine into firing its top prosecutor. In his own words, with video cameras rolling, Biden described how he threatened Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in March 2016 that the Obama administration would pull $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees, sending the former Soviet republic toward insolvency, if it didn’t immediately fire Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. ADVERTISEMENT “I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion.’ I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,’” Biden recalled telling Poroshenko. “Well, son of a bitch, he got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time,” Biden told the Council on Foreign Relations event, insisting that President Obama was in on the threat. Interviews with a half-dozen senior Ukrainian officials confirm Biden’s account, though they claim the pressure was applied over several months in late 2015 and early 2016, not just six hours of one dramatic day. Whatever the case, Poroshenko and Ukraine’s parliament obliged by ending Shokin’s tenure as prosecutor. Shokin was facing steep criticism in Ukraine, and among some U.S. officials, for not bringing enough corruption prosecutions when he was fired. But Ukrainian officials tell me there was one crucial piece of information that Biden must have known but didn’t mention to his audience: The prosecutor he got fired was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings that employed Biden’s younger son, Hunter, as a board member. U.S. banking records show Hunter Biden’s American-based firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, received regular transfers into one of its accounts — usually more than $166,000 a month — from Burisma from spring 2014 through fall 2015, during a period when Vice President Biden was the main U.S. official dealing with Ukraine and its tense relations with Russia. The general prosecutor’s official file for the Burisma probe — shared with me by senior Ukrainian officials — shows prosecutors identified Hunter Biden, business partner Devon Archer and their firm, Rosemont Seneca, as potential recipients of money. Shokin told me in written answers to questions that, before he was fired as general prosecutor, he had made “specific plans” for the investigation that “included interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.” He added: “I would like to emphasize the fact that presumption of innocence is a principle in Ukraine” and that he couldn’t describe the evidence further. ADVERTISEMENT William Russo, a spokesman for Joe Biden, and Hunter Biden did not respond to email messages Monday seeking comment. The phone number at Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC in Washington was no longer in service on Monday. The timing of Hunter Biden’s and Archer’s appointment to Burisma’s board has been highlighted in the past, by The New York Times in December 2015 and in a 2016 book by conservative author Peter Schweizer. Although Biden made no mention of his son in his 2018 speech, U.S. and Ukrainian authorities both told me Biden and his office clearly had to know about the general prosecutor's probe of Burisma and his son's role. They noted that: Hunter Biden's appointment to the board was widely reported in American media; The U.S. Embassy in Kiev that coordinated Biden's work in the country repeatedly and publicly discussed the general prosecutor's case against Burisma; Great Britain took very public action against Burisma while Joe Biden was working with that government on Ukraine issues; Biden's office was quoted, on the record, acknowledging Hunter Biden's role in Burisma in a New York Times article about the general prosecutor's Burisma case that appeared four months before Biden forced the firing of Shokin. The vice president's office suggested in that article that Hunter Biden was a lawyer free to pursue his own private business deals. President Obama named Biden the administration’s point man on Ukraine in February 2014, after a popular revolution ousted Russia-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych and as Moscow sent military forces into Ukraine’s Crimea territory. According to Schweizer’s book, Vice President Biden met with Archer in April 2014 right as Archer was named to the board at Burisma. A month later, Hunter Biden was named to the board, to oversee Burisma’s legal team. But the Ukrainian investigation and Joe Biden’s effort to fire the prosecutor overseeing it has escaped without much public debate. Most of the general prosecutor’s investigative work on Burisma focused on three separate cases, and most stopped abruptly once Shokin was fired. The most prominent of the Burisma cases was transferred to a different Ukrainian agency, closely aligned with the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, known as the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), according to the case file and current General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko. NABU closed that case, and a second case involving alleged improper money transfers in London was dropped when Ukrainian officials failed to file the necessary documents by the required deadline. The general prosecutor’s office successfully secured a multimillion-dollar judgment in a tax evasion case, Lutsenko said. He did not say who was the actual defendant in that case. As a result, the Biden family appeared to have escaped the potential for an embarrassing inquiry overseas in the final days of the Obama administration and during an election in which Democrat Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Fallout from Trump's weekend rally Biden beat Bernie but the battle between progressives and pragmatists still rages Biden still has a Hispanic voter problem, but does it matter? MORE was running for president in 2016. But then, as Biden’s 2020 campaign ramped up over the past year, Lutsenko — the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden once hailed as a “solid” replacement for Shokin — began looking into what happened with the Burisma case that had been shut down. Lutsenko told me that, while reviewing the Burisma investigative files, he discovered “members of the Board obtained funds as well as another U.S.-based legal entity, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, for consulting services.” Lutsenko said some of the evidence he knows about in the Burisma case may interest U.S. authorities and he’d like to present that information to new U.S. Attorney General William Barr Bill BarrNadler to subpoena AG Barr over Berman firing GOP rallies around Trump after firing of Manhattan US attorney Trump says Obama may have committed treason MORE, particularly the vice president’s intervention. “Unfortunately, Mr. Biden had correlated and connected this aid with some of the HR (personnel) issues and changes in the prosecutor’s office,” Lutsenko said. Nazar Kholodnytskyi, the lead anti-corruption prosecutor in Lutsenko’s office, confirmed to me in an interview that part of the Burisma investigation was reopened in 2018, after Joe Biden made his remarks. “We were able to start this case again,” Kholodnytskyi said. But he said the separate Ukrainian police agency that investigates corruption has dragged its feet in gathering evidence. “We don’t see any result from this case one year after the reopening because of some external influence,” he said, declining to be more specific. Ukraine is in the middle of a hard-fought presidential election, is a frequent target of intelligence operations by neighboring Russia and suffers from rampant political corruption nationwide. Thus, many Americans might take the restart of the Burisma case with a grain of salt, and rightfully so. But what makes Lutsenko’s account compelling is that federal authorities in America, in an entirely different case, uncovered financial records showing just how much Hunter Biden’s and Archer’s company received from Burisma while Joe Biden acted as Obama’s point man on Ukraine. Between April 2014 and October 2015, more than $3 million was paid out of Burisma accounts to an account linked to Biden’s and Archer’s Rosemont Seneca firm, according to the financial records placed in a federal court file in Manhattan in an unrelated case against Archer. The bank records show that, on most months when Burisma money flowed, two wire transfers of $83,333.33 each were sent to the Rosemont Seneca–connected account on the same day. The same Rosemont Seneca–linked account typically then would pay Hunter Biden one or more payments ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 each. Prosecutors reviewed internal company documents and wanted to interview Hunter Biden and Archer about why they had received such payments, according to interviews. Lutsenko said Ukrainian company board members legally can pay themselves for work they do if it benefits the company’s bottom line, but prosecutors never got to determine the merits of the payments to Rosemont because of the way the investigation was shut down. As for Joe Biden’s intervention in getting Lutsenko’s predecessor fired in the midst of the Burisma investigation, Lutsenko suggested that was a matter to discuss with Attorney General Barr: “Of course, I would be happy to have a conversation with him about this issue.” As the now-completed Russia collusion investigation showed us, every American deserves the right to be presumed innocent until evidence is made public or a conviction is secured, especially when some matters of a case involve foreigners. The same presumption should be afforded to Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, Devon Archer and Burisma in the Ukraine case. Nonetheless, some hard questions should be answered by Biden as he prepares, potentially, to run for president in 2020: Was it appropriate for your son and his firm to cash in on Ukraine while you served as point man for Ukraine policy? What work was performed for the money Hunter Biden’s firm received? Did you know about the Burisma probe? And when it was publicly announced that your son worked for Burisma, should you have recused yourself from leveraging a U.S. policy to pressure the prosecutor who very publicly pursued Burisma? John Solomon is an award-winning investigative journalist whose work over the years has exposed U.S. and FBI intelligence failures before the Sept. 11 attacks, federal scientists’ misuse of foster children and veterans in drug experiments, and numerous cases of political corruption. He serves as an investigative columnist and executive vice president for video at The Hill. Editor’s note: Subsequent to the publication of this op-ed and the election of a new president in Ukraine, Yuriy Lutsenko was removed from office and criminal proceedings opened against him for possible abuse of power; he also subsequently told the Los Angeles Times that he’d seen no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. ____________ During impeachment testimony, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent said there was the “possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest" regarding Hunter Biden's role at Burisma and then-Vice President Biden's role in Ukraine affairs for the Obama administration.
