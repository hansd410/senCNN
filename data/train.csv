Did President Obama save the auto industry? Even the most casual viewer of the Democratic convention would get the point: President Barack Obama saved the American auto industry. Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick called him the president "who saved the American auto industry from extinction." The former CEO of the super-sized used car dealership CarMax, Austin Ligon, said the president’s decisive action to restructure General Motors and Chrysler "helped prevent a domino effect that would have taken down everything in the auto industry, from the factories that manufactured auto parts to the dealers who sold the cars." And Michelle Obama talked about how her husband "fought to get the auto industry back on its feet." One should make allowances for the exuberance of political speech. But when a party shines a spotlight on a particular claim during the week when it trots out its best and brightest, we should take a closer look. We ask, did President Obama really save American auto makers? This is more a matter of opinion, and not an item for the Truth-O-Meter, but we can still shine some light on the question. In broad strokes, the answer is yes, but with some help from the other party and with one huge unknown -- no one can say what would have happened without massive government intervention. We spoke with a number of analysts and read many independent reports. There is no question that General Motors and Chrysler are profitable today. But so is Ford, a company that received no financial aid at all. The jobs have returned -- although not nearly at the level they were before the industry began its steep decline in 2007. Without a doubt, the American auto industry emerged smaller and more competitive. In the words of the bipartisan Congressional Oversight Panel that assessed the impact of the government's efforts: "The industry’s improved efficiency has allowed automakers to become more flexible and better able to meet changing consumer demands, while still remaining profitable." Barack Obama, however, cannot claim full credit for this outcome. According to several experts, he needs to share it with his predecessor, President George W. Bush. Dr. James Rubenstein at Miami University co-wrote a post-bankruptcy assessment for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Rubenstein said no one should overlook the importance of Bush’s decision to use $17.6 billion in TARP money in December 2008 to keep General Motors and Chrysler afloat. "The Bush Administration provided short-term bridge loans," Rubenstein said. "That allowed the Obama Administration to take a couple of months to assess the situation." Aaron Bragman, the lead American automotive analyst for the financial forecasting group IHS Automotive, echoed the point. "The Bush administration is the one that actually acted to save them from an uncontrolled bankruptcy and shutdown," Bragman said. "The Obama administration's role was to fix them." Layoffs in 2008 In 2008, the entire auto industry was in very bad shape. Layoffs at auto plants and among auto parts suppliers were on track to reach 250,000 workers. Gasoline prices were up and buying power was down. General Motors was virtually out of cash to pay its bills and Chrysler was not far behind. In November 2008, the New York Times ran the headline "GM teetering on bankruptcy, pleads for federal bailout". The Center for Automotive Research, an independent research group that gets some funding from automakers, predicted harsh outcomes if GM and Chrysler went belly up. Beyond the immediate jobs lost, there would be a partial collapse of the supplier industry that would lead to a 50 percent drop in production at Ford and the American-based foreign car plants. Imports would replace 70 percent of the lost GM and Chrysler production, the group predicted. When President Obama took office, he created a task force with a sweeping mandate to determine the fate of GM and Chrysler. The companies’ first proposals to the task force included downsizing, but the task force wanted deeper changes. In March 2009, Obama rejected those plans and said if the firms wanted federal money, they had to go through bankruptcy. That happened quickly. The car companies filed for bankruptcy in June and emerged in July. Between 2008 and 2010, carmakers closed or scheduled the closure of 16 plants and cut their ties with about 2,500 dealerships. Stockholders were wiped out and creditors such as banks and pension funds wrote off about two-thirds of the value of their claims. The companies shed their entire obligation to pay for the health care of retired autoworkers and that burden shifted to an independent trust fund in which the United Auto Workers union appoints five out of 11 board members. Under new ownership What emerged was a smaller American auto industry with a very different set of owners. The Italian car company Fiat became the majority stockholder of Chrysler. The second largest owner of Chrysler now is that retiree trust fund. For GM, the U.S. government now owns about 32 percent of the company. Private shareholders account for about 35 percent. The retiree trust fund owns about 10 percent. The union gave up the right to strike through 2015 and ended automatic pay raises. Back in 2007, it had agreed to a two-tiered wage scale that allowed the companies to hire new workers at much lower pay. Between the new wage rates and the savings from taking over retiree health costs, labor costs fell by about a third and are now on par with those of the foreign carmakers. The entire deal was financed with about $80 billion in taxpayer money. That included a special $5 billion set aside to keep cash flowing to car part suppliers when they found that their normal lines of credit had vanished. The turnaround Today, total employment for carmakers and parts suppliers is up about 250,000 from 2009. In 2011, sales rose 10 percent for GM, 13 percent for Ford and 14 percent for Chrysler. "Both Chrysler and General Motors are not just profitable," said Bragman. "They are significantly profitable, earning more now than they have in years." The benefits have not flowed simply to GM and Chrysler. In a speech this June, Ford’s CEO Alan Mulally said the bailouts were the right medicine for his company as well. "If GM and Chrysler would've gone into free-fall," Mulally said, "they could've taken the entire supply base into free-fall also, and taken the U.S. from a recession into a depression." There is no guarantee that these gains are permanent. The auto industry is on firmer ground because it can sell far fewer cars than it once did and still be profitable. However, making the cars and trucks that people want at the right price is a moving target. Still, the present success leaves critics asking whether it came at too high a price. The Treasury Department estimates that about $23 billion will never be repaid. For James Sherk, an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, much of that is due to "incredibly generous treatment of the unions." Sherk says the union’s retiree health benefit fund got about $21 billion more than it deserved compared to other creditors. Mitt Romney has taken up that claim, saying the bailout was flawed by "crony capitalism." The union counters that the trust fund does not belong to the union and the fund took on the substantial risk of providing healthcare for retirees for all the decades to come. According to the Center for Automotive Research, that shift alone accounted for two-thirds of the labor savings that have made the carmakers competitive. At the libertarian Cato Institute, Dan Ikenson says no one can know for sure, but he thinks disaster would not have occurred if the companies had been allowed to go through a normal bankruptcy. "I suspect some assets of both companies would have been sold off to other auto producers," Ikenson said. "And some assets and brands would have remained under the GM and Chrysler names." A key question for advocates of a conventional bankruptcy is whether private lenders would have come forward to finance any such deal. The view of most analysts is that the private money would not have been there. The Economist, one of the bastions of free-market thinking, came around to that view. Originally, it favored no government intervention. In April 2010, it offered an apology to President Obama. "Given the panic that gripped private purse-strings," the magazine wrote in an editorial. "It is more likely that GM would have been liquidated, sending a cascade of destruction through the supply chain on which its rivals, too, depended." Even Sherk at the Heritage Foundation gives Obama credit for forcing the carmakers to go through bankruptcy and the necessary restructuring that followed. The Economist concludes "by and large Mr Obama has not used his stakes in GM and Chrysler for political ends. On the contrary, his goal has been to restore both firms to health and then get out as quickly as possible." As we said in the beginning, it is impossible to know if the American auto industry would have fared better without government money, without government ownership, and without strong government intervention. Most likely, that debate would be more robust if the industry were not doing well. But for the moment, it is. The massive loss of jobs and the disruption to the network of auto parts suppliers did not happen. The shock that might have hit all car makers and the overall economy is not staring lawmakers in the face. Given the tangible reality of today, the view among most analysts is that President Bush kept the carmakers afloat long enough for President Obama to put them on solid footing moving forward. If that matches the definition of a rescue, then both presidents saved the auto industry.	1
Giffords Launches Six-Figure Ad Buy Calling out Gov. Rick Scott for Repeatedly Siding with the Gun Lobby Over Public Safety February 20, 2018— Today, Giffords, the gun violence prevention organization founded by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, combat veteran and retired NASA astronaut Captain Mark Kelly, released a new six-figure television ad calling out Florida Governor Rick Scott for repeatedly siding with the gun lobby over public safety. The ad, which will begin airing on Tuesday, underscores that even as Florida suffered from mass shootings in Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and now Parkland, Governor Rick Scott has actively sought to weaken the very gun laws that could have protected Florida communities. Peter Ambler, Giffords Executive Director: “The tragic shooting in Parkland, Florida has sparked grassroots outrage across the state and country. People are angry that time after time, politicians have chosen gun lobby contributions over public safety. They’ve offered “thoughts and prayers,” but refused to take action to stop the shootings. Nowhere is this problem thrown into sharper relief than in Florida, where Governor Rick Scott has complied with the gun lobby’s every wish, speaking at the NRA convention and even signing legislation that prevented doctors and mental health professionals from addressing threats relating to firearms with their patients. In the aftermath of Orlando and now Parkland, he’s done nothing to protect his fellow citizens. We’re educating Florida voters about the governor’s tragic record on gun safety and sending a message to all who seek public office: Enough! Voters are going to be examining politicians records on gun safety very closely this year, and we’re ready to help them make informed decisions.” In particular, the ad points out that the Governor signed a bill into law that levied penalties against doctors for discussing gun safety with patients. In February 2017, the law was struck down by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Physicians’ right to speak freely with patients about gun safety is a necessary element of providing good healthcare, especially when patients demonstrate a higher risk of suicide or live in homes with children. A critical component of addressing our nation’s gun violence epidemic is supporting the candidates who will stand up to the gun lobby and fight for safer gun laws. Giffords campaigns in key elections to elevate the issue of gun safety and build gun violence prevention majorities from state houses all the way up to the United States Senate. Elections last year sparked what has become the ‘suburban rebellion’ in 2018 and voters in these key districts overwhelmingly support safer gun laws. Giffords has taken on and defeated other prominent Florida politicians with poor gun safety records. In 2016, Giffords partnered with House Majority PAC to launch a targeted direct mail campaign to hold Rep. John Mica accountable for accepting a campaign donation from the NRA just two days after the shooting at Pulse Nightclub, and his refusal to vote to close loopholes in federal law that let dangerous people buy a gun without a background check.b. Representative Stephanie Murphy went on to win that race. Hours after the Parkland shooting, Giffords launched a new national campaign – #VoteCourage – to get people to pledge to support candidates in November who will stand up to the gun lobby and fight for safer communities. View the ad, “Gag Order” here. A transcript is below: Orlando, Ft. Lauderdale, Parkland. We need to stop dangerous people from getting guns. But Governor Rick Scott made it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun. Even a mental health professional. This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down. Governor Scott, we need more than your thoughts and prayers. Stop putting the gun lobby ahead of our safety. ###	1
Great Regional Body The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River Basin comprise the world’s largest source of surface fresh water. This water is one of North America’s most important natural resources. It must be protected. That is why the Governors of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, have partnered together to ensure these waters thrive. Since 2008, the States have worked together to enact laws that protect this water, and continue to coordinate their work through the Great Lakes—St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Council.	0
2015 Poverty Guidelines U.S. Federal Poverty Guidelines Used to Determine Financial Eligibility for Certain Federal Programs [Federal Register Notice, January 22, 2015 Full text ] [Prior Poverty Guidelines and Federal Register References Since 1982] [Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs)] [Further Resources on Poverty Measurement, Poverty Lines, and Their History] [Computations for the 2015 Poverty Guidelines] There are two slightly different versions of the federal poverty measure: The poverty thresholds, and The poverty guidelines. The poverty thresholds are the original version of the federal poverty measure. They are updated each year by the Census Bureau. The thresholds are used mainly for statistical purposes — for instance, preparing estimates of the number of Americans in poverty each year. (In other words, all official poverty population figures are calculated using the poverty thresholds, not the guidelines.) Poverty thresholds since 1973 (and for selected earlier years) and weighted average poverty thresholds since 1959 are available on the Census Bureau’s Web site. For an example of how the Census Bureau applies the thresholds to a family’s income to determine its poverty status, see “How the Census Bureau Measures Poverty” on the Census Bureau’s web site. The poverty guidelines are the other version of the federal poverty measure. They are issued each year in the Federal Register by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The guidelines are a simplification of the poverty thresholds for use for administrative purposes — for instance, determining financial eligibility for certain federal programs. The Federal Register notice of the 2015 poverty guidelines is available. The poverty guidelines are sometimes loosely referred to as the “federal poverty level” (FPL), but that phrase is ambiguous and should be avoided, especially in situations (e.g., legislative or administrative) where precision is important. Key differences between poverty thresholds and poverty guidelines are outlined in a table under Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). See also the discussion of this topic on the Institute for Research on Poverty’s web site. The following figures are the 2015 HHS poverty guidelines which are scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on January 22, 2015. (Additional information will be posted after the guidelines are published.) 2015 POVERTY GUIDELINES FOR THE 48 CONTIGUOUS STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 2015 POVERTY GUIDELINES FOR ALASKA 2015 POVERTY GUIDELINES FOR HAWAII The separate poverty guidelines for Alaska and Hawaii reflect Office of Economic Opportunity administrative practice beginning in the 1966-1970 period. Note that the poverty thresholds — the original version of the poverty measure — have never had separate figures for Alaska and Hawaii. The poverty guidelines are not defined for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau. In cases in which a Federal program using the poverty guidelines serves any of those jurisdictions, the Federal office which administers the program is responsible for deciding whether to use the contiguous-states-and-D.C. guidelines for those jurisdictions or to follow some other procedure. The poverty guidelines apply to both aged and non-aged units. The guidelines have never had an aged/non-aged distinction; only the Census Bureau (statistical) poverty thresholds have separate figures for aged and non-aged one-person and two-person units. Programs using the guidelines (or percentage multiples of the guidelines — for instance, 125 percent or 185 percent of the guidelines) in determining eligibility include Head Start, the Supplemental Nutition Assistance Program (SNAP), the National School Lunch Program, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Note that in general, cash public assistance programs (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Security Income) do NOT use the poverty guidelines in determining eligibility. The Earned Income Tax Credit program also does NOT use the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility. For a more detailed list of programs that do and don’t use the guidelines, see the Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs). The poverty guidelines (unlike the poverty thresholds) are designated by the year in which they are issued. For instance, the guidelines issued in January 2015 are designated the 2015 poverty guidelines. However, the 2015 HHS poverty guidelines only reflect price changes through calendar year 2014; accordingly, they are approximately equal to the Census Bureau poverty thresholds for calendar year 2014. (The 2014 thresholds are expected to be issued in final form in September 2015; a preliminary version of the 2014 thresholds is now available from the Census Bureau.) The poverty guidelines may be formally referenced as “the poverty guidelines updated periodically in the Federal Register by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).”	0
Georgia’s unemployment rate drops to 6.9 percent Georgia’s unemployment rate fell to 6.9 percent in December from 7.2 percent in November, as holiday hiring kicked into overdrive, the state labor department said Thursday. “This was the first time in eight years that we’ve had job growth in December,” state labor commissioner Mark Butler said in a statement. Holiday hiring is usually done by then. But employers added 900 jobs from November to December, bringing Georgia’s total to 4,196,400 — the highest level since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007. Retail trade, warehousing and transportation, which are industries associated with holiday hiring, accounted for virtually all of the job growth, the labor department said. Over the past year, Georgia added 108,200 jobs, which pushed down the unemployment rate from 7.4 percent in December 2013. “We ended the year with our rate dropping below 7 percent for the first time since last April,” Butler said. “I’m especially pleased that we had very strong 2.7 percent over-the year job growth, which gave us our largest December-to-December growth since 1999.” The key growth sectors were professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, construction, and trade and transportation. Georgia still has a long way to go to catch up with the recovery nationally. The U.S. unemployment rate was 5.6 percent in December. Employers here are still laying off a lot of workers, at least temporarily. There were 57,510 new claims for unemployment insurance filed in December — an increase of 102 percent from November. Of that number, 48.5 percent were temporary claims filed mostly in textile manufacturing and construction due to seasonal layoffs. Additional temporary claims for benefits were filed in administrative and support services, and accommodations and food services. Over the past year, however, new claims for unemployment insurance were down by 12.7 percent from December 2013. Most of that decline came in manufacturing and construction. Support real journalism.
